## 🧠 Why I Made This Project

I created this project to review Python after stopping for a long time.  
My goal was to refresh my skills by making a small and simple project.

## 🎯 Random Number Game

This is a simple Python terminal game where the player tries to guess a number randomly chosen by the computer between 1 and 1000.

## 🕹️ Game Rules

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 1000, and the player must guess it.
- After each guess, the computer provides a hint: **"Up!"** if the guess is too low, or **"Down!"** if it’s too high.
- The player has up to 20 attempts to guess the correct number. If they fail, the game ends.
